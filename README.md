**Description of our Project**

For our final project, we created an engaging create-your-own-adventure game from the perspective of the engineering manager who has to make difficult decisions related to AI Algorithms in the hiring process. Players are presented with different decisions while hiring a new team member to highlight the impact of seemingly small decisions that can lead to discriminatory outcomes. There are four stages in the game: making a job posting, screening candidates, interviewing candidates, and sending out job offers. Players encounter scenarios where the use of AI makes the hiring decision easier but not necessarily non-discriminatory. After this game, users will be able to better manage social issues as they enter the workplace and participate in the hiring process.

## Installation Instructions

**Prerequisites**

* git: Follow instructions at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
* Node.js (version 14 or later): Download from https://nodejs.org/
* npm (included with Node.js installation)

**Cloning the Repository**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., `cd Desktop`).
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [URL]

**Start the Back-end Server**
1. Navigate to the back-end directory using: cd back-end
2. Install dependencies using: npm i
3. After installing dependencies, start the back-end server using: npm run dev

**Start the front-end Server**   
5. Now, open a new terminal window in the root directory to start the front-end server.
6. Navigate to the front-end directory using: cd front-end
2. Install dependencies using: npm i
3. After installing dependencies, start the front-end development server using: npm run dev

**Running the game**
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (or the specific port used by your front-end that was given).

**Troubleshooting**
Check Node.js and npm versions: Ensure compatibility with your project's package.json.
Dependency Errors: Delete node_modules folders and re-run npm i in both directories.
Firewall Permissions: Ensure firewall settings allow necessary ports.
