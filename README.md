## 🎯 Project Overview

When future engineers or hiring managers use AI-powered tools, subtle decisions can lead to unintended discriminatory outcomes. This project invites the user to step into the role of an engineering manager making hiring decisions in four stages:

1. Job Posting – Define the role, requirements, and wording.
2. Candidate Screening – Choose how to process candidate profiles (including AI-assisted screening).
3. Interviewing – Select interview questions, decide evaluation criteria, and manage AI tool suggestions.
4. Offer Decisions – Send offers, or reject candidates, and observe the downstream effects.

Throughout the game, you’ll see how the use and design of AI in the hiring pipeline — and seemingly minor decisions — can amplify bias or hinder diversity. The goal is to raise awareness of social & ethical issues in tech hiring and prepare participants to make more thoughtful design/management decisions in real organizations.
